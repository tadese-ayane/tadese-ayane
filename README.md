<!--
Please note, this package is about IMPLEMENTATION of CommonMark (https://commonmark.org/), not about markdown itself. We stay aside of markup discussions. Prior to reporting a bug, make sure it's about implementation issues.

**Before you post**

1. Read the CommonMark spec: https://spec.commonmark.org/
2. Check the reference implementation for parse errors: https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/

**In your report**

It will be very helpful if you can provide permalinks with online samples and explain the difference:

- Online demo of `markdown-it`: https://markdown-it.github.io/
- Online demo of reference CommonMark's implementation: https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/

If you wish to provide a code sample, make sure it is as small as possible and can be executed.
